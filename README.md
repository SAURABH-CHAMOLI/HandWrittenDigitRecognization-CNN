# HandWrittenDigitRecognization-CNN

Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
The Handwritten Digit Recognition project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately identify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels.

Key Features of the Project:
Dataset Preparation:

Loading Data: The MNIST dataset is loaded and split into training and testing sets.
Normalization: Pixel values are normalized to the range [0, 1] to improve the convergence of the neural network during training.
Model Architecture:

Convolutional Layers: These layers automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features from input images. The model typically includes multiple convolutional layers followed by activation functions (ReLU) and pooling layers (MaxPooling).
Fully Connected Layers: After the convolutional and pooling layers, the output is flattened and passed through fully connected layers to perform the final classification.
Training the Model:

Compilation: The model is compiled with a loss function (e.g., categorical cross-entropy), an optimizer (e.g., Adam), and metrics (e.g., accuracy).
Training: The model is trained on the training set, and validation is performed on a validation subset of the data to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
Evaluation and Testing:

Testing: The trained model is evaluated on the test set to measure its accuracy and generalization capability.
Visualization: The results can be visualized using confusion matrices and sample predictions to understand where the model performs well and where it might need improvements.
Performance:

Accuracy: CNN models typically achieve high accuracy on the MNIST dataset, often exceeding 98%.
Loss: The training and validation loss are monitored to ensure the model is learning effectively and not overfitting.
Project Benefits:
High Accuracy: The use of CNNs, which are particularly effective for image recognition tasks, ensures high accuracy in digit recognition.
Real-World Applications: This project showcases the practical application of deep learning techniques in optical character recognition (OCR) systems, which are widely used in various fields like postal mail sorting, bank check processing, and digitizing written documents.
Educational Value: The project serves as a valuable learning tool for understanding how deep learning models, particularly CNNs, work and how they can be applied to solve real-world image recognition problems.
This project demonstrates the power of convolutional neural networks in processing and classifying visual data, laying the groundwork for more advanced image recognition tasks.
